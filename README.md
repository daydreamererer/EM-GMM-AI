# EM-GMM-AI
EM algorithm on Gaussian Mixed Model 

- using EM algorithm to calculate the parameters of a Gaussian mixed model.
- the dataset is the height of both male and female in an aritificial-intelligence course, assume the distribution is Gaussian with parameter $\left( \mu_{1}, \sigma_{1} \right)$ for male and $\left( \mu_{2}, \sigma_{2} \right)$ for female
- figs show the basic analysis of the results inferred by EM algorithm.
